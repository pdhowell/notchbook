# Fluxo

**Fluxo** is a native macOS expandable utility that lives near the notch and provides quick access to media controls, system shortcuts, camera preview, and file management — all within a fluid, customizable interface.

Designed to reduce context switching, it brings frequently used actions into a compact UI that expands only when needed.
